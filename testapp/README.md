 **docker-project Git commands**

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/coolboy-nitor/docker-project.git
git push -u origin main


if your SSH key is either not set up, not added to the SSH agent, or not added to your GitHub account.


Use HTTPS Instead of SSH (If You Prefer Simpler Setup)

If you donâ€™t want to set up SSH, you can switch your remote to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/coolboy-nitor/docker-project.git


Then try:

git push -u origin main

**React & node based testapp is added**

using command:
install node and docker first
app command : 

"npx create-react-app testapp"

testapp folder will be created :
to run app:

cd testapp
"npm start"

node_modules contains all the dependencies required to run our react app
so we do not deploy this instead we delete this and use command :

"node install"

"node start"

so this node_modules will get installed and application will be running.

Now create a Dockerfile in the testapp directory.

install docker extension.

created a docker file with all instructions 

run docker file using  docker build . command

to check image is build or not use docker images ls command.

Now docker run command

application will run inside container we can access this inside container but with localhost it will give error because we haven't yet expose port to outside world to access our application lets do this

 docker run -p 3000:3000 941e8c1a53a1    # this is how we bind 3000 port to outside world or we can say we expose 3000 port to outside world. so that everyone can access our application.

 to run container in detach mode 
 docker run -d -p 3000:3000 941e8c1a53a1  

to create multiple containers from single image we have to use different ports
docker run -d -p 3001:3000 941e8c1a53a1  
docker run -d -p 3002:3000 941e8c1a53a1 

if we use the same port then 3000:3000 we will get an error



so when we create multiple containers we have to manually shutdown stoped containers so what if
when we stop container it should automatically gets removed. cool 
so that we use this command

docker run -d --rm -p 3002:3000 941e8c1a53a1 

To create custom name container 
docker run -d --rm --name "mywebapp" -p 3002:3000 941e8c1a53a1 

to stop container 

docker stop "container_name"

to tag a name to image we use 
docker build -t mywebapp:02 .

to delete docker image 

when we update our application we create new container and exicute the command this will reflect
all the new changes in our application. This is used to maintain the versions of your application
docker run -d --rm --name "mywebapp" -p 3002:3000 mywebapp:03
